    title: The concept of Un-Mute
    content: |
      Un-Mute's goal is to emancipate the music scene while producing artists chosen - without discrimination - by their fans.
      It is an <strong>interactive and accessible platform</strong> that <strong>facilitates the organisation of concerts in Belgium</strong> through <strong>crowd-funding</strong>.
      Un-mute creates a network of Belgian artists, different types of concert halls, and fan producers.
  how_it_works:
    title: How it works
    content: |
      Once the artist is signed up and added to the <a href="%catalog_url%">artist catalogue</a>, they choose a date and a type of venue. An event is then created which allows interested fans to buy a concert ticket and participate in the realisation of the event. Fans, through the financing of the event, become producers of the concert.

      <strong>For the event to be confirmed,</strong> a set number of tickets need to be sold in a given time-frame (30 days).

      <strong>If the set number of tickets are sold,</strong> the concert takes place! In addition, this concert can generate up to 2 additional concerts in Belgium thanks to the <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" title="multi-local tour" data-content="Un-mute gives each artist a chance to secure up to 3 concerts in different venues in Belgium thanks to crowd-funding. <a href='%faq_url%'>More info</a>">multi-local tour</a> system.

      If the minimum number of tickets are not sold, the concert doesn't take place, the fans are fully reimbursed, and the artist can try again by creating a new event!

team:
  title: Our team
  members:
    pierre: <span class='um-label um-semi-bold'>Pierre</span>, head of the project, has been in the music scene for over ten years. Having been a member of several bands, Pierre has had the experience of the hard work a band has to go through to be seen on stage. Due to his frustrations, he has worked on developing an inovative vision for booking concerts in the francophone music scene in Belgium.
    gonzague: Captivated by this concept, <span class='um-label um-semi-bold'>Gonzague</span>, a webmaster with a degree in computer sciences, accepted this project right away. To him, the coordination of the development of a platform of this magnitude is a motivating challenge and coincides with his desire to participate in the launch of a start up.
    louis: Sought for ensuring the legal framework of this project, <span class='um-label um-semi-bold'>Louis</span> didn't take long to accept the invitation. The possibility of putting the knowledge gained from his five years of legal training to work for a project with important underlying values convinced him to fully commit to Un-Mute.
    alice: "Regarding communication, <span class='um-label um-semi-bold'>Alice</span> brings her 6 years of professional experience in SMEs and non-market institutions to the team. Since she graduated from IHECS and the KUL with a degree in cultural studies, Un-Mute was a great opportunity to finally be involved in a line of business that she's always been passionate about: cultural and event communication!"

pillars:
  title: Our values
  intro: The Un-Mute team is articulated around 3 main principles which summarize the will of the carriers of the project.
  accessibility:
    title:  Accessibility
    content: Un-Mute is accessible to all by not making any selection and by setting up crowdfundings that allow anyone who knows how to convince his public to evolve without constraints. Thus, the platform is addressed to any Belgian musical artist, and this, whatever its level of performance, age or style of music. Similarly, over time, Un-Mute may consider increasing the territory in which it is present.
  continuity:
    title: Continuity
    content: Un-Mute doesn't want to be limited to a concert for its artists, and wants to be able to offer them a <a href="%faq_url%">multi-local tour</a>. Ultimately, Un-Mute wishes to offer a global development framework to its artists, which would take into consideration all the aspects inherent in the emancipation of musical artists (image, sound, broadcasting, etc.).
  synergy:
    title: Synergy
    content: Un-Mute wants to be the crossroads between artists, producers and professionals of the sector, but we also want to play on the diversity of our artists. For Un-Mute, one plus one equals three. It is from this desire that was born the principle of multi-local tour.

faq:
  title: FAQ
  confirmed_show:
    question: What is a "confirmed festival"?
    answer: There are "events", which are artists trying to leverage enough tickets sales to unlock a festival at some fixed date. And there are "confirmed festivals", which are events with enough tickets sold (i.e. enough producers) after one month.
  minimum_tickets:
    question: How many tickets need to be sold for an event to be confirmed?
    answer: |
          Our festivals can take place in various venues, which we grouped in different categories.

          Depending of the venue category chosen by an artist when he/she creates an event, he/she will need to sell a certain number of tickets to obtain its confirmation.
    metric_minimum: "# minimum tickets"
    metric_maximum: "# maximum tickets"
    hall_examples: Venues examples
    depends: Depends on the venue
  multilocal:
    question: Apparently it is possible for Un-Mute to organize up to 2 additional concerts once one concert is unlocked, how is that possible?
    answer: |
      Un-Mute takes into account the fees for the artist who initiated the event, but also for one or two invited artists. This allows us to develop the principle of multi-local touring.

      In other words, as each artist who unlocks a festival, actually gets enough budget to pay for two invited artists, Un-Mute will bring two artists of its network on stage the night of the festival. In return, the artist will have the opportunity to also play as invited artist when other Un-Mute artists will unlock their festival.
  cancelling:
    question: Unfortunately, I can't get to a festival for which I bought a ticket, what can I do?
    answer: If the festival is already confirmed, then refunds are impossible. Un-Mute proposes to replace your ticket with a ticket for any (not sold out) other confirmed festival.

    alexis: "Passionné de musique, <span class='um-label um-semi-bold'>Alexis</span> a été vite conquis par l’idée du projet. Doté d’expérience en événementiel et actif au sein d’une agence digitale depuis plus de 3 ans, Alexis entend mettre à disposition son expérience en communication digitale et en coordination de projets pour soutenir la croissance de l’ASBL. Le projet constitue en effet à ses yeux un véritable potentiel pour réunir deux ses aspirations : la musique et l’entreprenariat, au sein d’une équipe motivée et multidisciplinaire."
